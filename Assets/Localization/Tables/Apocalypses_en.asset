      humanity to live on water and mineral salts, many people did not survive this
      strict diet, dying of natural causes, or becoming prey to larger animals.

      are more ferocious than ever. Concerning the population, there is a ratio of
      70 chickens to 1 human being. They reproduce very quickly, due to their bodies
      getting used to Growth Rations after years of consuming them. Now, due to the
      quantity, they became the living being at the top of the food chain, the humans
      now take second place.

      seat of the bus, the ladies then entered into a physical conflict, which led
      to collective hysteria, bringing out people''s most primitive instincts, triggering
      a civil war and, in the future, the World War III.
